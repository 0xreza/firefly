Firefly: A Lightweight Asynchronous IO Library

firefly is built on the top of epoll as an abstraction layer. 
It is also aimed to be as light and fast as possible. So we have to avoid making it tooooo complex. 
Firefly is here to make the life easier.

Coming features:
* supporting threadpool and workerpool
* add any other file description to the event loop, firefly takes care of them not only connections
